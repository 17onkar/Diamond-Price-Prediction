# Diamond-Price-Prediction
 Diamond Price Prediction! 💎
📚 In this notebook, I explore a comprehensive dataset of diamond attributes and prices. Using machine learning techniques, I develop a predictive model to estimate diamond prices based on various features such as carat , cut, clarity, color, and depth.
🔍 I apply data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and outliers, perform feature engineering to extract meaningful information, and evaluate multiple regression algorithms including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
📈 The results are promising, with the model achieving high accuracy in predicting diamond prices. The notebook also includes visualizations using Seaborn to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different features and price.
🌟 Whether you're a data scientist, diamond enthusiast, or curious learner, I invite you to check out the notebook and share your thoughts!
Any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
